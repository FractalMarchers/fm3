[Fractal Marching in ThreeJS](https://fractalmarchers.github.io/fm3/)

## Dev Notes

To get started, add a new shader and update the `currentShader` string in `js/index.js` or just modify the existing one. If you need to access external data in your shader from the user/ThreeJS, add another variable to `uniforms`

Note: NPM is just being used to setup ESLint with google's javascript style. If you want to also use it, run `npm install`. All other dependencies are located in `js/lib/`.
